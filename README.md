# Non-Interactive-Diffie-Hellman

## Part of coursework: CS 579-A @ Stevens Institute of Technology



Hi. First, I hope you like the code.

Secondly, I have added some extra checks while creating this file just to make sure I am understanding
the arguments perfectly. When I say that I mean there might be some extra output which isn't really 
required, however, since it was not a problem and rather a bit informative to anyone who looks a C
program for the first time. I never removed those.

Thirdly, I am not making my program to create a file with extension "b64". Hence, the output will be
whatever the argument is. So if you give an argument, say, "example", the newly created file will be
named "example" and not "example.b64".

Fourthly, there are two shell scripts, namely, "compile.sh" and "execute.sh" and does the job of
compiling and then executing in the exact expected manner (it will delete and overwrite any previously
created similar named folder or file). It is there to ease the work. It is a good idea to use it.
